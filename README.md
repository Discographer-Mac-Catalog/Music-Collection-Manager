Discographer is a sophisticated music collection manager that enables users to catalog, browse, and manage their entire music library with precision and ease. Designed for musicians, collectors, and audiophiles, it offers a comprehensive set of features to keep your audio files organized and accessible.

The application supports batch importing, automated metadata fetching from online databases, and custom tagging. You can create dynamic playlists, view listening statistics, and even export your collection for external use. Discographer also includes tools for detecting duplicates, managing vinyl records, and integrating with popular streaming services.

Built with a focus on performance and usability, Discographer runs smoothly on all modern Mac systems, including those with Apple Silicon. It respects your privacy and works entirely offline once your library is set up.
